SQLite vs PostgreSQL: What You Need to Know
===========================================

SQLite
------
- SQLite is a file-based database. All your data is stored in a single file (e.g., instance/users.db).
- Strength: Easy to set up, great for development and debugging. You can open the file with a DB viewer and inspect your data.
- Weakness: Not suitable for production hosting. On platforms like Heroku or Render, the file location can change or be wiped every 24 hours, causing data loss.
- Use SQLite for local development and testing only.

PostgreSQL
----------
- PostgreSQL is a powerful, server-based relational database. It can handle millions of records and is reliable for production use.
- Data is stored on a managed server, not in a local file. This means your data is safe and persistent.
- Most hosting providers (Heroku, Render, etc.) recommend PostgreSQL for production apps.

Upgrading from SQLite to PostgreSQL
-----------------------------------
1. Create a new PostgreSQL database using your hosting provider's dashboard.
2. Copy the Internal Database URL from the database info section.
3. Set your SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI environment variable to this URL in your web service settings.
   - Example: postgresql://username:password@host:port/dbname
   - Make sure the URI starts with 'postgresql' (not 'postgres').
4. No code changes needed if you use SQLAlchemy—just update the URI.
5. Install the 'psycopg' package (PostgreSQL adapter for Python) in your requirements.txt.

Why SQLAlchemy Makes Switching Easy
-----------------------------------
- SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that abstracts away the database engine.
- You can switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL by just changing the database URI—no need to rewrite your models or queries.

Summary
-------
- Use SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production.
- Update your database URI and requirements.txt for deployment.
- SQLAlchemy and psycopg make switching databases seamless.
